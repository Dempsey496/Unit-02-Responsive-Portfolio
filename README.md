## Starting off

I took this homework as a chance to not only practice my grid systems and Bootstrap components, but also a way to practice getting my name out there by using a professional looking and smooth functioning website.

I will constantly be going back to improve and update my website even after I submit it for homework. I mostly excited about expanding my portfolio to not just pictures (right now it looks like im trying to be a model) but to add all the websites I have created/improved.

## Process

* My normal first step would be to sketch out a rough draft of how I would like my website to look to the user. Since layouts were already provided for his homework, I was able to get right into design and structuring.

* I first copied the Bootstrap CSS and found a collapsable navbar that would best fit my needs. 

* I had to make several changes to the Bootstrap code. For example: in order to make my un-collapsed navbar float to the right side of the screen I had to change mr to ml (Even though I thought it would be the opposite).

* I added footers to each page. This was very simple to create and after just copied it to all 3 files (I plan on going back and making it a sticky footer so it will always stay at the bottom of the page).

* Next came the body of each page. Each was a little different but most were a Bootstrap card with simple modifications. 

* The hardest part of the body of each page was creating the containers, rows, sub-rows, and columns. Taking in mind that some people will be viewing it full screen on a laptop, and others would be viewing it on a smaller mobile screen.

* Changing my filler __Lorem__ and __Header__ text with my personalized text was easy enough and took no coding.

* I then began work on my navbar functionality. I added href links and copied to each file. I did have some trouble with showing the active link. Eventually I just had to manually set the text color for the active page darker than the others.

* My last step was to replace divs with more semantic html. This did cause some problems here and there but will help to idenfify specific parts of the code.
